    "If you're running a business or working for a company, you'll quickly learn that you need to spend money to make money. There's a balancing act between how much money to spend and how much money you will make. The question is, how do we quantify this so we can easily compare how valueable a potential project is? This is where net present value can be applied. Net present value (NPV) is a commonly used metric in finance and accounting to evaluate and compare anything that involves cash flow, such as loans, investments, and business projects. "

    "All cash flows are discounted by the discount rate, r, when used in the NPV formula. But what is the meaning of discount rate? The discount rate captures the concept of future dollars not being as valuable as present dollars. Therefore, to determine the present value of all future cash flows, each individual cash flow is devalued as a function of the time from present and the discount rate. For example. If you will recieve \\$1,000 a year from now, and your discount rate is 10\\% a year, discounted yearly, then its present value is \\\\$900, or \\\\$1000 less 10\\% of \\\\$1000. If the \\\\$1000 you are receiving is not coming until 2 years from now, then you must discount it twice, the present value will now be \\\\$810.\n",

    "How is this discount rate determined? The discount rate is determined by the minumum return on investment that the investor wants. This may be influenced by things such as how the company is being financed or how much the return on investment is on relatively safe projects. The lower you set your discount rate, the more projects will be economical because of the lower required rate of return on investment. "
